Scala provides robust error handling mechanisms, primarily through its use of exceptions and the `Try` and `Either` data types. Here's an overview of each:

1. **Exceptions:**
   Scala uses exceptions for error handling similar to many other programming languages. Exceptions are thrown using the `throw` keyword and caught using `try-catch` blocks. Here's a simple example:

   ```scala
   try {
     val result = riskyOperation()
     println(result)
   } catch {
     case ex: Exception => println("An error occurred: " + ex.getMessage)
   }
   ```

   In this example, if `riskyOperation()` throws an exception, it will be caught and an error message will be printed.

2. **Try:**
   Scala provides the `Try` data type, which represents a computation that may either result in an exception or a value. It's a functional way of dealing with exceptions. `Try` has two subtypes: `Success` and `Failure`. You can use pattern matching to extract the result or handle the failure case. Here's an example:

   ```scala
   import scala.util.Try

   val result: Try[Int] = 
    Try(10 / 0)

   result match {
     case Success(value) => println("Result: " + value)
     case Failure(exception) => println("An error occurred: " + exception.getMessage)
   }
   ```

   In this example, `result` will be a `Failure` containing an exception because dividing by zero throws an exception.

3. **Either:**
   Scala also provides the `Either` data type for error handling. It represents a value of one of two possible types: `Left` or `Right`. Conventionally, `Left` is used for errors and `Right` for successful results. Here's an example:

   ```scala
   def divide(x: Int, y: Int): Either[String, Int] =
     if (y == 0) Left("Division by zero")
     else Right(x / y)

   val result: Either[String, Int] = divide(10, 0)

   result match {
     case Left(error) => println("Error: " + error)
     case Right(value) => println("Result: " + value)
   }
   ```

   In this example, `result` will be a `Left` containing the error message because dividing by zero is not allowed.

Each of these mechanisms has its use cases, and the choice often depends on the specific requirements of the application and personal preference in coding style.

In Scala, several keywords and constructs are associated with error handling:

1. **throw:** Used to explicitly throw an exception. It's followed by an instance of `Throwable` or one of its subclasses.

   ```scala
   throw new RuntimeException("Something went wrong")
   ```

2. **try:** Begins a block of code in which exceptions may occur. Used in conjunction with `catch` and optionally `finally`.

   ```scala
   try {
     // code that may throw an exception
   } catch {
     case ex: Exception => // handle the exception
   } finally {
     // optional block of code that is executed regardless of whether an exception was thrown
   }
   ```

3. **catch:** Used within a `try` block to specify one or more exception handlers. Each `catch` block specifies the type of exception it can handle.

   ```scala
   try {
     // code that may throw an exception
   } catch {
     case ex: IOException => // handle IOException
     case ex: RuntimeException => // handle RuntimeException
   }
   ```

4. **finally:** An optional block of code that follows the `try` block and is executed regardless of whether an exception was thrown. It's often used for cleanup tasks.

   ```scala
   try {
     // code that may throw an exception
   } finally {
     // cleanup code
   }
   ```

5. **Success:** Represents the successful result of a computation in the `Try` monad.

   ```scala
   import scala.util.Success

   val result: Try[Int] = Success(42)
   ```

6. **Failure:** Represents the failure of a computation in the `Try` monad.

   ```scala
   import scala.util.Failure

   val result: Try[Int] = Failure(new RuntimeException("Something went wrong"))
   ```

7. **Left:** Represents the left side (typically the error case) of an `Either` instance.

   ```scala
   val result: Either[String, Int] = Left("Error message")
   ```

8. **Right:** Represents the right side (typically the success case) of an `Either` instance.

   ```scala
   val result: Either[String, Int] = Right(42)
   ```

These keywords and constructs form the foundation of error handling in Scala, providing developers with flexibility and expressiveness in dealing with errors and exceptions.
