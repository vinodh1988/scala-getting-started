Create a function that takes callback as a parameter

Application:

* the function should pass a 10x10 matrix  with seat numbers

* filled seats must be represented with X

* available seats must be represented with seat numbers

* the user callback must print the matrix

* should return an array of seat numbers to the function

* the function would allocate the seats and callback
with modified matrix

* new seat booking can continue again

* if the user instead of sending array send null
the process should stop
