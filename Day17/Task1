For the 
Sales , Products and Customer
schemas

Sales(transaction_id,product_id,customer_id,units)
Products(product_id,name,price)
Customers(customer_id,name, address,city)

create a table SalesCFamily in Keyspaces
with all the columns in the three tables 
(transaction_id,product_id,productname,customername,salesamount)

Note: salesamount = price*units

Create a Spark job to perform join
operation on the tables
and write the result to Keyspaces
